# Fake Text Story Video Generator

This is a video creation tool that you can generate fake iMessage styled text story videos with text-to-speech, sound effects, and customizable backgrounds.
I'm pretty sure you came across those videos on tiktok and youtube shorts where two AI voice actors read out a fake text message conversation. This type of videos are fun and fairly engaging, but to make them either you need to pay for AI tools or edit videos yourself on tools like capcut, which costs money and very time consuming. That's why I created this website, to simply create fake text interface and render it into a video with voiceovers, background videos and sound effects.
